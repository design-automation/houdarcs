# Overview

The plugins for simulation and analysis are grouped into six main areas:

- Daylight Simulation: Calculate illuminance or irradiance either at specific times during the day or over an entire year.
- EnergyPlus: Calculate heating and cooling loads based on building construction, schedules, and other data. (See Figure 8.)
- Structural Simulation: Calculate stress and strain using finite element methods for various types of structures.
- Network Analysis: Calculate various metrics for graphs, including shortest paths, centrality, connectivity, and so forth.
- Space Syntax: Generate axial line maps and calculate depth, integration, mean depth, and R2 correlation.
- Window Analyst: Calculate various metric for windows in urban environments, including the sky view factor, sky visibility factor, unobstructed view factor, solar factor, and privacy factor.

The development of Houdarcs was initially developed for building optimisation, and is currently being further developed for urban design.
